This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
WD <- getwd();
DATA_DIR <- "data"
file_path <- file.path(WD, DATA_DIR, "covid19-sp-BR.csv");
coviso_data <- read.csv(file_path, header = TRUE, sep = ";");
```

```{r}
W = 5;
N = nrow(coviso_data)
NW = floor(N/W);
caws = vector("numeric", NW)
print(length(caws))
pi.su <- 0 # sum the number of cases
for (nw in 1:NW) {
  j <- nw*W
  caws[nw] = sum(sum(coviso_data[1:j, 2]))
}
plot(caws)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
